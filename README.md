# Hopscotch Frontend Test

> Link to live site:

I implemented this test using a personal template that uses Svelte, Tailwind, & Typescript. This template includes some utils that I often use in projects.

I originally wanted to make this as physically realistic as possible, which is why you'll find a lot of movement related variables in the code. Although the result does feel a little like a real physical one, there are a few details that I decided not to do just because of the time limit.

## How to run

> In case something doesn't build or install, I'm using npm version is 9.6.7, node v18.17.1 and yarn 1.22.19.

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
